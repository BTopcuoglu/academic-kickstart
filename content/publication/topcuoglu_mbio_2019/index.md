abstract: "Prediction of health outcomes using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these ML models is likely over-optimistic. Moreover, there is a trend towards using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step towards developing more reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of health outcomes but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies."
