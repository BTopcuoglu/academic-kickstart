I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Schloss Lab at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on integrating data science and microbial ecology to improve human health. I care deeply about implementing "Do No Harm" principles when using machine learning in health care. I use computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to study the human microbiome.

I am invested in communicating my science with the public. I am a Science Communications Fellow at the University of Michigan Natural History Museum, a Software Carpentry Instructor and a NerdNight Alum.
