Learning goals of this talk are:

1. Learn what ML is.
2. Learn basic ML terminology.
3. Learn about a couple of different ML algorithms.
4. Define a ML problem.
5. Decide which ML model to use.
6. Construct our dataset.
7. Transform our dataset.
8. Train a ML model.
9. Use the ML model to make predictions.
10. Evaluate if our ML solved our problem.


__We will learn to identify and avoid common mistakes in ML studies. Create reproducible ML models.__

This tutorial does not presume or require prior knowledge in machine learning. However, to follow the lessons and for the code-along, we recommend learners to meet the following prerequisites.

Be comfortable with intro-level algebra.
Proficiency in programming basics with some experience coding in R.
